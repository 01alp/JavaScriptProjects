With the passing of time and evolution of technology, the human brain has been requesting
more and more stimuli to keep the brain occupied. Boredom happens whenever
people don't receive enough of these stimuli. And you are not receiving enough
of it, so you decide to make **your own game**. And to make it more challenging you decide to use
JavaScript to make it.

Your game will be single player only and you will have to create your
own engine and tools for the game. And as you try to search for all sorts
of information you start to remember all the [60 FPS memes](https://pics.me.me/60-fps-59-fps-35518800.png).
